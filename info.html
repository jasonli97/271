                    WelcomeU offers a solution to allow students connect with other peers, manage housing, and 
                    use a compatiable device to unlock their dorm rooms. This way students don't have an issue when 
                    finding roomates, chatting with classmates and being locked out their dorm room.

                    We stand out from the rest since we offer a more <em> unified </em> approach.  
                    Instead of having mutiple sites or apps to download. Students are able to access 
                    our servies on desktop and mobile. From just <strong> one site</strong>.

                    This also offers University admins in having a <em> unified </em> approach 
                    to manage <strong>  student credentials, and housing </strong>.  We also intergrate 
                    with <strong> existing SSO credentials </strong> for an easier sign in process.
